# Interactive-3D-Flip-Board
How this works:
HTML structure is fully semantic with <article>, <h3>, <img>, and <p>.
3D flip is accomplished by:
Applying transform: rotateY(180deg) to the inner wrapper on .flip-card:hover.
Both faces are position: absolute with backface-visibility: hidden.
A container .flip-card applies perspective for depth.
Design: Modern look, rounded corners, box-shadow, Google Fonts, distinct colors, and smooth transitions.
Button on Back: Large, styled, and interactive.
Accessible: Supports keyboard focus via focus-within.
You can expand this by duplicating the entire <article class="flip-card"> section for more cards, or customize the content/image/colors for your project needs!.
